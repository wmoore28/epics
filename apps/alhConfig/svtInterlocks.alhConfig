$GUIDANCE
The vacuum at the downstream end of the PS vacuum chamber is bad. This may indicate a leak in the SVT/FEB cooling system.
Further increase in this value will trip the software interlock, stopping both chillers and closing both chiller valves.
Contact the SVT expert for further guidance.
$END

CHANNEL INTERLOCKS HPS_INTLK:NO_BEAM:intlk_status
$GUIDANCE

Reset the interlock and make SVT BIAS ALL ON.
