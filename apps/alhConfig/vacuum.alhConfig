                The cold cathode gauge at the moller region is out of spec.  
                This means the vacuum between the shield wall and the tagger
                magnet has degraded.  Use the MYA Viewer and monitor the hallb_VCG2C21Tr
                to check for trends in the past few hours.  If the vacuum is degrading (values increasing on 
                the plots) then contact engineering on call.   Also contact MCC and inform them about the
                problem, they might want to shut off the beam and close some valves to isolate the problem.
                If the vacuum spiked and recovered, continue taking
                data.
