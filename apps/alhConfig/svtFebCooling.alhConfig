CHANNEL FEB_COOLING HPS_SVT:PLC:i:RTD_FE_Supply-Value
$COMMAND  medm -x -attach -cmap -macro "sig=HPS_SVT:PLC:i:RTD_FE_Supply-Value" aiaocalc_alarm.adl >> /dev/null 
$GUIDANCE
The RTD temperature at the vacuum chamber feedthrough for cooling supply to the frontend boards is outside its normal range.
If the temperature continues to rise or fall, the software interlock will shut down the FEB chiller and all SVT voltages will trip.
Contact the SVT expert if this alarm was not expected as part of a procedure.
$END

CHANNEL FEB_COOLING HPS_SVT:PLC:i:RTD_FE_Return-Value
$COMMAND  medm -x -attach -cmap -macro "sig=HPS_SVT:PLC:i:RTD_FE_Return-Value" aiaocalc_alarm.adl >> /dev/null 
$GUIDANCE
The RTD temperature at the vacuum chamber feedthrough for cooling return from the frontend boards is outside its normal range.
If the temperature continues to rise or fall, the software interlock will shut down the FEB chiller and all SVT voltages will trip.
Contact the SVT expert if this alarm was not expected as part of a procedure.
$END

CHANNEL FEB_COOLING HPS_SVT:PLC:i:Flow_FE-Value
$COMMAND  medm -x -attach -cmap -macro "sig=HPS_SVT:PLC:i:Flow_FE-Value" bibo_alarm.adl >> /dev/null 
$GUIDANCE
The flow through the FEB cooling loop is below the setpoint of the flow switch.
This may happen because the chiller has stopped, or because the solenoid valve has closed.
Contact the SVT expert if this alarm was not expected as part of a procedure.
$END

CHANNEL FEB_COOLING HPS_SVT:PLC:i:Valve_FE-Shutdown
$COMMAND  medm -x -attach -cmap -macro "sig=HPS_SVT:PLC:i:Valve_FE-Shutdown" bibo_alarm.adl >> /dev/null 
$GUIDANCE
The solenoid valve at the FEB chiller outlet is closed.
This valve is controlled by the PLC, and is closed when a PLC interlock has tripped.
Contact the SVT expert if this alarm was not expected as part of a procedure.
$END

CHANNEL FEB_COOLING HPS_FE:CHILLER:STATUSBIT
$COMMAND  medm -x -attach -cmap -macro "sig=HPS_FE:CHILLER:STATUSBIT" aiaocalc_alarm.adl >> /dev/null 
$GUIDANCE
The FEB chiller is not running.
The chiller may have been stopped by a software interlock.
Contact the SVT expert if this alarm was not expected as part of a procedure.
